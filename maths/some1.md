# SoME1
SoME1 is an exposition held by [3b1b](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)
and friends, in which mathematical presentations of all forms
(PDFs, animations, jupyter notebooks, to name a few) were summoned and
reviewed in the summer of 2021.

The top 5 submissions selected by the jury was made into a short
video introduction on 3b1b's YouTube channel.

I also participated by submitting a Pluto notebook, introducing
the topic of [_norms on linear transformations_](/maths/norm.jl).
Unfortunately, I did not get selected even into the top 100.
However, if you are interested in knowing my opinion on the subject,
