# Projective Geometry
Although I have taken a course on projective geometry in the first year of my Master
program, the best book on this subject I have ever read turned out to be
is Andrew Zisserman's _Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision_

I would like to continue update this post and add more personal notes from reading
the book:

02. [2D projective geometry](/maths/andrew_zisserman/projective_geometry/02-2D_projective_geometry.jl).
